# 🔍 CyberLens

CyberLens is a modern desktop cybersecurity application designed to scan URLs and files
for potential security threats. The project focuses on detecting malicious URLs
(phishing, malware domains) and identifying suspicious files using hash-based analysis.

CyberLens is built primarily for educational and personal cybersecurity use and demonstrates
practical implementation of secure coding, networking, and malware detection concepts.
